**Goal of the Project**\
The primary goal of this project is to enable a user to perform complex analysis without needing prior knowledge of machine learning or data science. The system should be accessible for users to ask questions, set requirements, and have automated agents deliver the relevant data analysis or model creation without manual coding or technical expertise.

**Overview of System Components**

1. **Default Start: New Ask from Scratch**\
   The entry point for users is to input their requirements or ask a specific question. This entry acts as the foundation of the user's request. A user may initiate any form of analysis by simply describing what they want. The system will then determine the data, analysis requirements, and how best to approach model creation.

   - **User Input**: The user will ask anything related to their requirements (e.g., "How has player performance affected team wins this season?").
   - **Process**: The system will analyze the input and determine if there is an existing dataset that can be utilized or if new data is needed. It will also decide the specific agent type (domain-specific) to perform the analysis.
   - **User Experience**: The user experience can start fresh with a chat involving the Entry Agent, which guides them to other agent clusters as needed. Alternatively, users may browse existing models and data to jump ahead in the process by selecting specific data sources or models.

2. **Data Collection and Analysis**\
   Once a user's requirements are understood, the system moves to data collection, analysis, and ultimately model creation.

   - **Collector Strategy**: This component involves gathering data based on existing API connections, web scraping, or local datasets. The DataCollector Cluster will decide the best source to use, prioritizing stored data first, followed by APIs, and then web scraping to create a usable dataset for future analysis.
   - **Data Evaluation & Tagging**: Once data is gathered, it undergoes evaluation and tagging for quality, completeness, and further analysis metrics.
   - **Analysis Agent Creation**: Based on user needs, the system creates a domain-specific analysis agent (e.g., basketball performance metrics, financial market analysis).

3. **Model Creation and Processing**

   - **Model Creation**: If the analysis requires predictive insights, the system will automatically initiate model creation. This involves data transformation, cleaning, and using pre-set frameworks to train models according to the userâ€™s requirements.
   - **Data Transformation and Cleaning**: Data transformation and cleaning are handled by a cluster of agents that have access to various cleaning and transformation tools. The agents select the most relevant tools based on the data type and the model to be trained.

4. **Artifacts and Libraries**
   The system stores various artifacts that can be reused by users, including data, models, and agents, making them easily accessible for analysis. Libraries are available to help users explore these artifacts interactively.

   - **Model Library**: Contains all available pre-trained models for a user to select and use in their analysis.

   - Data Library: Provides access to datasets that have been processed and stored.

   - **Agent Library**: Stores analysis agents that have been created by users to perform domain-specific analysis. These agents are stored in the repository for future reuse, allowing users to apply them to different tasks.

     - **Customization**: Analysis Agents can be customized based on user needs and are responsible for generating relevant insights or predictions.
     - **Knowledge Integration**: Agents may also search for knowledge documents to improve their performance, ensuring that added knowledge is necessary rather than redundant.
     - **Tool Creation**: Agents can create and store code as tools (noting the associated security risks).
     - **Model Fine-Tuning**: In niche cases, agents may manage fine-tuning models if needed.

5. **Storage Structure**\
   Storage is organized to enable effective data retrieval, reuse, and versioning.

   - **Metadata Table**: Contains details of each dataset, including source, update timestamps, quality metrics, and a description. It also tracks versions of datasets, providing essential information given the unstructured nature of the stored data.
   - **Raw Data Storage**: Unprocessed data collected through scraping or APIs.
   - **Asynchronous Data Processing**: Includes tagging and evaluation that happens post-storage, helping maintain data quality.

6. **Agent Strategy**
   Agents are critical to this project, as they work together to form an automated workflow. The agents are divided into two main types: Collaborative Agent Clusters and Analysis Agents.

   - **Collaborative Agent Clusters**: These clusters are used by the system to perform various tasks, such as data collection, transformation, and evaluation, behind the scenes. Each cluster represents a group of agents, tools, and knowledge working together to achieve a specific objective. For example, the data collection cluster includes agents that interact with existing data, collect new data sources, search for new API connections, and set up or call existing API connections.

7. **Use Cases**

   - **Editing Existing Datasets and Analyses**: Users can revisit existing data and edit its requirements or create new analyses. The Data Evaluation Collaborative Agent Cluster will ensure that any proposed new dataset is of higher quality than the previous version.
   - **New Analysis from Scratch**: Users can create a new analysis if no related data is available by initiating data collection, agent selection, and model creation.
   - **Improving Existing Agents**: Users can improve the current agents or modify the agents' instructions to provide better or more customized results.

8. **Collector Strategy**
   The system collects data using different strategies:

   - **Lookup via Embeddings**: Similar to a semantic search, embeddings allow quick determination if relevant datasets already exist.
   - **Web Scraping and APIs**: If no relevant data exists in storage, agents can either use public APIs or perform web scraping. Web scraping is conducted when no API or easier connection is available.
   - **Retry and Validation**: Each Collaborative Agent Cluster should include retry and validation agents that analyze errors, provide feedback, and enable agents to work through issues. Errors and solutions should be stored to memory to help agents become more adept at solving issues over time.
